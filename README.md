# MCA_XBRL_data_extraction
This is a project which uses xml (AOC-4) form to extract financial and operational data using Python. 

Put the XML file in the same folder as the py files and run script to run python.bat which references those py files to run.

The output will be in the form of CSV files.

Financials.py pull financial data like Profit and Loss, Balance Sheet in a standardized format so that comparison can be done. For this, i have mapped all the taxonomies from 2011, 2012, 2015, 2016 and IND-AS.

Other .py files pull some important data from the filing like shareholding, related party transactions, borrowings, asset schedule, among others. 

Note: There might be issues in the code so please use with caution. If you are using the repo then i will not be held liable for any outcome on using the code. 

For Ex. Flipkart India Pvt. Ltd. financials
